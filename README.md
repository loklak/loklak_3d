## File Naming Suggestion:
- If you add a new design, add a ```i0``` to the file name ('iteration 0'), followed with your nickname.
- If you enhance an existing design, use the same file name, replace the author nickname with your own and increase the iteration count (i.e. for the first enhancement: ```i1```)
